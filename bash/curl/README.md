# API4AI people background removal

This directory contains a minimalistic sample that sends requests to the API4AI People Background Removal API.
The sample is implemented in `bash` using `curl` command-line tool.


## Overview

This API provides segmentation photos of people with consequent background removal.


## Getting started

Try sample with default args:

```bash
bash sample.sh
```

Try sample with your local image:

```bash
bash sample.sh image.jpg
```

Try sample and parse with `jq` tool (note: you may need to install [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) separately) for pretty formatted output:

```bash
bash sample_jq.sh
```
